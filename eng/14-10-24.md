- He said that they will be here soon
- He told me that she has finished now

- She told us she would go to France the week after
- He told me he was going to see a good film that night
- He said she would be there in half an hour
- He asked me where I was going
- He wanted to know why hasn't she done her homework
- He asked me if I was enjoying myself
- She wondered if I looked right
- The teacher advised us to not cheat in the exam
